# sudoku-image-recognition
This is a simple image recognition project for the [sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) puzzle.
I created it using python, opencv, and PIL.

The project is divided into two parts:
    
1. Recognition 
    - first, the bot will take a picture of the sudoku puzzle and save it to a file.
    - then, the bot will use the pre-made digits png files to
    construct the sudoku puzzle.
2. Solving
    - the bot will use the constructed sudoku puzzle to solve it using a 
    brute force algorithm.
